# CS433 Programming Assignment 1
This assignment aims to help you review C/C++ data structures and familiarize you with Unix/Linux programming. 
You will implement a ReadyQueue class as a priority queue of processes. Read the assignment instructions carefully and complete all "TODO"s in the code. 
After completing "TODO"s, remove them from your code. Do not change the interface of the ReadyQueue class, except for adding comments, as they are used
in the test programs. 

There are two test programs to test the correctness and performance of your implementation. A makefile
is provided for building the executables `test1` and `test2`. To build the executables `test1` and `test2`, type `make` at the command line. Then run each test and confirm the outputs match with the "test1_out.txt" and "test2_out.txt" files. 
```
$ make
$ ./test1
$ ./test2
```
Your code should follow the design guileline, work correctly for all tests and be robust for potential error conditions, and free of dangerous code constructs and memory leaks.
